## Active Tasks

### Manual Testing (In Progress)

Test each skill with natural language triggers:

- [ ] **Component Creator**
  - [ ] "Create a button"
  - [ ] "I need an input component"
  - [ ] Verify files created in `./fluxwing/components/`

- [ ] **Library Browser**
  - [ ] "Show me all components"
  - [ ] "Browse the library"
  - [ ] Verify displays bundled templates

- [ ] **Component Expander**
  - [ ] "Add hover state to my button"
  - [ ] "Make this component interactive"
  - [ ] Verify updates existing files correctly

- [ ] **Screen Scaffolder**
  - [ ] "Build a login screen"
  - [ ] "Create a dashboard"
  - [ ] Verify creates `.uxm`, `.md`, `.rendered.md`

- [ ] **Component Viewer**
  - [ ] "Show me the submit-button"
  - [ ] "View component details"
  - [ ] Verify displays metadata and ASCII

- [ ] **Screenshot Importer**
  - [ ] "Import this screenshot"
  - [ ] "Convert screenshot to uxscii"
  - [ ] Verify extracts components from image

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Cross-skill workflows
  - [ ] Create component → View it → Expand it
  - [ ] Build screen → View components → Modify them
  - [ ] Import screenshot → Browse generated components

- [ ] File operations
  - [ ] Skills READ from bundled templates correctly
  - [ ] Skills WRITE to project workspace (`./fluxwing/`)
  - [ ] No writes to skill directories
  - [ ] Proper file permissions

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Skill activation speed
- [ ] Template loading performance
- [ ] Agent spawning efficiency
- [ ] Large screen composition performance

---

## Documentation Tasks

### High Priority

- [ ] Create migration guide for existing users
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section to README
- [ ] Document common workflows and examples
- [ ] Create video walkthrough of skills in action

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Add contributing guidelines for skills development
- [ ] Document skill architecture patterns
- [ ] Create FAQ section
- [ ] Add changelog

### Low Priority

- [ ] Create advanced usage guide
- [ ] Document extension points
- [ ] Add performance tuning guide

---

## Enhancement Ideas

### Skill Improvements

- [ ] Add validation skill (dedicated schema validation)
- [ ] Add export skill (convert to different formats)
- [ ] Add theme skill (design tokens and theming)
- [ ] Add animation skill (interaction patterns)

### Template Additions

- [ ] Add more component templates (20+ total)
- [ ] Add more screen examples (5+ total)
- [ ] Create domain-specific templates (e-commerce, SaaS, etc.)
- [ ] Add responsive layout examples

### Tooling

- [ ] Create CLI validator for .uxm files
- [ ] Add schema linting
- [ ] Create component preview tool
- [ ] Add automated testing for templates

### Documentation Modules

- [ ] Add design system guide
- [ ] Add responsive design patterns
- [ ] Add accessibility best practices
- [ ] Add component composition guide

---

## Known Issues

### To Investigate

- [ ] Skill activation reliability with various phrasings
- [ ] Cross-skill template references on Windows
- [ ] Large file handling (100+ component libraries)
- [ ] Concurrent skill activation behavior

### To Fix

- [ ] None currently identified

---

## Future Considerations

### Community

- [ ] Set up community contribution workflow
- [ ] Create template submission guidelines
- [ ] Establish code review process
- [ ] Plan for template marketplace

### Ecosystem

- [ ] Integration with design tools (Figma, Sketch)
- [ ] Export to frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- [ ] Import from other formats (HTML, Penpot)
- [ ] API for programmatic access

### Standards

- [ ] uxscii spec versioning strategy
- [ ] Breaking change migration path
- [ ] Backward compatibility plan
- [ ] Schema evolution process

## Testing Commands

### Quick Verification
```bash
# Check all skills exist
ls .claude/skills/fluxwing-*/SKILL.md

# Count supporting files
find .claude/skills/fluxwing-* -name "*.uxm" -o -name "*.schema.json" | wc -l

# Verify SKILL_ROOT usage
grep -r "SKILL_ROOT" .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md | head -5
```

### Natural Language Test Prompts
1. "Create a button"
2. "Show me all components"
3. "Add hover state to my button"
4. "Build a login screen"
5. "Show me the primary-button"

## Quick Start - Testing the Skills

### Install Skills
```bash
# Auto-detect location (recommended)
./scripts/install.sh

# Or install globally
./scripts/install.sh --global
```

### Test with Natural Language
Try these prompts in Claude Code:
1. **"Create a button"** → fluxwing-component-creator
2. **"Show me all components"** → fluxwing-library-browser
3. **"Add hover state to my button"** → fluxwing-component-expander
4. **"Build a login screen"** → fluxwing-screen-scaffolder
5. **"Show me the primary-button"** → fluxwing-component-viewer
6. **"Import this screenshot"** → fluxwing-screenshot-importer

### Uninstall Skills
```bash
# Preview what would be removed
./scripts/uninstall.sh --dry-run

# Uninstall with confirmation
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```
