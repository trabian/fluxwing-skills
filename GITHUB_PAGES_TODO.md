# Fluxwing GitHub Pages Redesign - TODO

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26 (Late Evening - Documentation Complete!)

This TODO tracks the implementation of the ASCII-first GitHub Pages redesign as outlined in `GITHUB_PAGES_REDESIGN_PLAN.md`.

---

## Audit Notes (2025-10-24)

- `docs/css/ascii-core.css`: Design tokens, typography, and base utilities in place; status tokens (`--ascii-success`, `--ascii-warning`, `--ascii-error`) added 2025-10-24—cross-file dependency note now lives at the top of `docs/css/components.css`.
- `docs/css/responsive.css`: Breakpoints and grid helpers align with plan; requires manual viewport regression (added in Phase 1.3 subtasks) before closing out testing. Hero ASCII swap now extends to 48rem, eliminating the mid-width overflow (2025-10-26 update).
- `docs/css/components.css`: Core components exist plus initial status variants for buttons/cards; Phase 2.3 actions will flesh out active/disabled patterns, status messaging content, and accessibility affordances. Updated hero ASCII rules mirror the responsive breakpoint to keep compact art active through tablets (2025-10-26 update).
- `docs/index.html`: Semantic structure and placeholder content match Phase 3 scaffolding; hero/logo assets remain placeholder ASCII blocks pending Phase 2.1 deliverables. Status examples now wired into hero CTA buttons (success/warning) and value prop grid (success card with `aria-live`). Mobile fallback ASCII (`.hero__ascii--compact`) added to prevent overflow on narrow screens. Added cache-busting query strings for CSS/JS and switched favicon to `docs/favicon.svg` after resolving 404 (2025-10-26 update).
- `docs/js/main.js`: Hero art lazy-load works for static text but lacks error telemetry/logging—consider enhancing during Phase 4 interaction work. Script now controls hero ASCII visibility up to the 48rem breakpoint and wires the mobile nav toggle with Escape handling and viewport reset (2025-10-26 update).

---

## Upcoming Execution Plan (Sprint Backlog)

**Task 1 · Token & Markup Audit**
- Cross-reference `docs/css/ascii-core.css` tokens with design system requirements (colors, spacing, typography) and note any missing semantic color variables (success, warning, error) plus border/glow variants.
- Trace token usage across `docs/index.html`, `docs/css/responsive.css`, and `docs/css/components.css`; document mismatches or duplications directly beneath Phase 2.4 items.
- Acceptance: Updated checklist items under Phase 2.4 include the newly identified variable deltas.

**Task 2 · Responsive Grid Regression Checklist**
- Produce a viewport matrix covering xs (<32rem), sm (32–48rem), md (48–64rem), and lg (≥64rem) with rows for hero, primary nav, value props, workflow steps, showcase grid, docs links, footer.
- Specify validation method for each cell (e.g., expect 1-column stacking, nav toggle visible, etc.) and record it under Phase 1.3 subtasks.
- Schedule and document a run of `npm run docs:dev` in TODO once the checklist exists; include instructions for capturing ASCII or screenshot evidence.
- Acceptance: Phase 1.3 subtasks reference the matrix and call out where findings/logs will be captured in this file.

**Task 3 · ASCII Logo Planning**
- Inventory existing ASCII assets (`docs/assets/fluxwing-hero.txt`, placeholders in `docs/index.html`) and identify alignment constraints (character width, target max columns).
- Define tooling approach (manual editor, FIGlet variants, custom script) and document it under Open Questions/Dependencies once decided.
- Outline embed strategy per placement (header hero art vs. nav toggle vs. footer badge), noting any CSS wrappers required.
- Acceptance: Phase 2.1 task list reflects tooling choice and embed strategy, with TODO entries for each asset variant.

**Task 4 · CRT Effects Scaffolding**
- Create `docs/css/crt-effects.css` with commented sections for scanlines, phosphor glow, flicker, curvature, and toggles; include `prefers-reduced-motion` guard stubs.
- Determine class naming convention for enabling/disabling effects (`.is-crt-enabled`, etc.) and reference it in both the file and Phase 2.2 checklist.
- Plan integration points in `docs/index.html` (e.g., body modifier class, hero container) and note any JS hooks needed later.
- Acceptance: File scaffold committed, Phase 2.2 subtasks updated with class name and fallback notes.

**Task 5 · Component Inventory & Accessibility Brief**
- Catalog existing component selectors in `docs/css/components.css` (buttons, cards, navigation, terminal window) and map missing states/variants required by the plan. _Current selectors: `.hero`, `.hero__*`, `.ascii-box`, `.ascii-card`, `.ascii-border*`, `.section-divider`, `.ascii-button`, `.hero__cta-button`, `.showcase__filters button`, `.value-prop`, `.showcase__card`, `.docs-links__grid article`, `.installation__commands`, `.installation__checklist`, `.validator-placeholder`, `.terminal-window*`, `.primary-nav*`, `.mobile-nav__list`, `.installation__commands code`._
- Draft accessibility requirements per component (focus visibility, aria roles, keyboard behavior), referencing WCAG checkpoints.
- Outline testing strategy for high-contrast mode and status messaging once variants land (e.g., simulate success/error alerts in buttons/cards).
- Feed gaps back into Phase 2.3 subtasks, adding bullets for each state/requirement pair.
- Acceptance: Phase 2.3 subsection lists state coverage plus accessibility tasks, and audit notes confirm inventory completion.

**Color Contrast Test Matrix (WCAG 2.1 AA)** _(Updated 2025-10-26)_

Color values from `docs/css/ascii-core.css`:
- Background: `--ascii-bg: #0a0e14` (dark blue-gray)
- Alt Background: `--ascii-bg-alt: #141c28`
- Card Background: `--ascii-bg-card: #1a2332`

Requirements:
- Normal text (<18pt): ≥4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (≥18pt): ≥3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components: ≥3:1 contrast ratio

| Element | Foreground | Background | Use Case | WCAG Level | Notes |

| Nav border | #00ffff (cyan) | #0a0e14 | Navigation | UI (3:1) | Visual separation |

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Use WebAIM Contrast Checker: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
2. Test each foreground/background pair from the table above
3. Record actual contrast ratio in table
4. Mark PASS/FAIL based on WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
5. If any fail, adjust color values in `docs/css/ascii-core.css`

**Expected Results:**
- All bright colors (#66ff66, #66ffff, #f0f0f0) should pass AA easily (likely 7:1+)
- Cyan (#00ffff) should pass AA for normal text (likely 6:1+)
- Green (#33ff33) should pass AA for normal text (likely 5:1+)
- Dim green (#00cc00) may need adjustment if below 4.5:1
- All UI component colors should pass 3:1 minimum

**Action Items if Tests Fail:**
- [ ] If dim green (#00cc00) fails: increase brightness to #00dd00 or similar
- [ ] If success green (#33ff66) fails: adjust to brighter #44ff77
- [ ] If warning amber (#ffaa33) fails: adjust to brighter #ffbb44
- [ ] If error red (#ff3366) fails: adjust to brighter #ff4477
- [ ] Re-test after any adjustments

**Deliverable:** Site has full ASCII aesthetic, CRT effects work, all components styled.

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions Log
- **2025-10-24:** Chose heavy borders (╔═══╗) for major sections, light borders (┌───┐) for cards
- **2025-10-24:** Decided on green/cyan terminal palette over other retro options (amber, white)
- **2025-10-24:** CRT effects will be toggle-able to accommodate motion sensitivity
- **2025-10-26:** Hero section pulls rendered ASCII directly from `fluxwing/screens/*.rendered.md` (AI DJ Mixer) via lazy load to emphasize real Fluxwing output
- **2025-10-26 (Evening):** Switched from ASCII box-drawing borders to CSS borders for logo to resolve cross-browser alignment issues. The FLUXWING block letter text remains pure ASCII, but border/styling is now handled by CSS (.logo-text class) for reliable rendering across all viewports and browsers
- **2025-10-25:** Using CLI specify tool as visual inspiration for ASCII-first design patterns and terminal aesthetics (specify is installed locally)
- _(Add future decisions here)_

### Open Questions
- Should we include example videos or stick to ASCII demos?
- Do we need a blog section for announcements?
- Should community components be showcased on main site or separate page?
- ~~What tool or process should we use to generate and iterate on ASCII logo variants while keeping alignment consistent across hero, nav, and footer placements?~~ **RESOLVED (2025-10-26):** Using CSS borders instead of ASCII box-drawing for reliable cross-browser rendering

### Dependencies
- IBM Plex Mono font (web font)
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Analytics platform (PostHog configured in old site)
- ASCII art editor or generator capable of outputting aligned text blocks for hero/footer/mobile logos
- **CLI specify** (installed locally) - Visual design reference for ASCII-first patterns and terminal aesthetics

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** ASCII art doesn't align on some devices
  - **Mitigation:** Extensive cross-browser testing, fallback simplified borders
- **Risk:** Heavy ASCII slows down mobile load times
  - **Mitigation:** Simplify borders on mobile, lazy load below-fold content
- **Risk:** Accessibility issues with ASCII decorations
  - **Mitigation:** Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, thorough testing
