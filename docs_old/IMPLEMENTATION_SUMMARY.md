# Fluxwing Website Implementation Summary

## What Was Completed

All content updates that don't require new assets have been implemented based on the WEBSITE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md.

### ✅ Homepage Updates (`index.html`)

**1. Hero Section**
- ✅ New headline: "Design Systems That Humans AND AI Agents Understand Natively"
- ✅ Updated lede emphasizing derivation and universal interface
- ✅ Updated hero note highlighting ASCII as universal interface

**2. Value Grid**
- ✅ Expanded from 4 to 5 cards
- ✅ New messaging for all cards:
  1. Universal Interface (humans + AI)
  2. Derivation Model (like OOP for design)
  3. Component Evolution (build through references)
  4. Living Documentation (specs AI executes)
  5. AI-Native Design (perfect comprehension)

**3. New Section: Derivation Model**
- ✅ Added complete section with ASCII derivation tree
- ✅ Visual diagram showing component inheritance
- ✅ Explanation of derivation vs duplication
- ✅ Key message: "Change the base → All derivations inherit"

**4. How It Works Section**
- ✅ Updated from 4-step to 5-step workflow
- ✅ New steps focus on derivation:
  1. Create Base Component (`/fluxwing-create button`)
  2. Derive Variations (`--extends button`)
  3. Compose Components (build forms from parts)
  4. Build Screens (AI reads library)
  5. Let AI Generate (living documentation)

**5. Footer**
- ✅ New tagline: "Design systems that humans AND AI agents understand natively"
- ✅ Updated legal text emphasizing derivation
- ✅ Added "ASCII is the universal interface" subtitle

**6. Meta Tags**
- ✅ Updated title, description for new positioning
- ✅ Added Open Graph tags for social sharing
- ✅ Added Twitter Card tags

### ✅ New Pages Created

**1. `/why.html`** - Complete page explaining:
- The Problem (3 columns: For Humans Only, Duplication Nightmare, Not Version Control Friendly)
- The Solution (2 columns: For Humans, For AI Agents)
- Why Teams Choose Fluxwing (4 testimonial-style benefits)
- Comparison Table (Fluxwing vs Figma vs Sketch)
- Navigation header and footer
- Meta tags for SEO

**2. `/use-cases.html`** - Complete page covering:
- AI Agent UIs
- Rapid Prototyping
- Design Systems at Scale
- Living Documentation
- Navigation header and footer
- Call-to-action section

## Key Messaging Changes

### Before
- "AI-Native ASCII UX Design"
- "Rapidly iterate on UI designs using ASCII mocks"
- Focus on prototyping and iteration speed

### After
- "Design Systems That Humans AND AI Agents Understand Natively"
- "ASCII is the universal interface"
- "Build through derivation, not duplication"
- Focus on:
  1. Universal comprehension (humans + AI)
  2. Derivation model (inheritance vs duplication)
  3. Component evolution (organic library growth)
  4. Living documentation (AI-executable specs)

## What Still Needs Assets

These pages/features are ready to be created but require visual assets:

### Missing Assets
1. **Social preview image** (1200x630px)
   - For Open Graph and Twitter cards
   - Should show: Fluxwing logo + tagline + ASCII component example

2. **Derivation tree visual diagram**
   - SVG version of ASCII tree for Why page
   - Could be auto-generated from ASCII in CSS

3. **Screenshots**
   - Terminal showing `/fluxwing-create button`
   - Component library browser
   - Validation output

### Pages Not Yet Created
- `/features.html` (9-feature grid - straightforward to create)
- `/faq.html` (8 Q&A pairs - straightforward to create)

### Navigation Enhancement
- Global sticky header with menu (partially implemented inline)
- Could be extracted to shared component
- Mobile menu toggle needed

---

## How to Test Locally

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Or use the npm script:
npm run ghpages:serve
```

Then visit:
